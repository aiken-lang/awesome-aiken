## Libraries

#### Infrastructure

- [aiken-lang/setup-aiken](https://github.com/aiken-lang/setup-aiken) - A GitHub action for installing and using Aiken in Github Workflows

#### Standard library & extras 

- [aiken-lang/stdlib](https://github.com/aiken-lang/stdlib) - The official standard library
- [Cardano-Fans/acca](https://github.com/Cardano-Fans/acca) - Extensions to the standard library
- [SundaeSwap-finance/aicone](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/aicone) - Several reusable Aiken libraries
- [LogicalMechanism/assist](https://github.com/logicalmechanism/assist) - A collection of specialized Aiken functions.
- [aiken-extra/*](https://github.com/aiken-extra) - A collection of additional aiken functions to build tests and help debug.

#### Cryptography 

- [ilap/bls](https://github.com/ilap/bls) - High-level BLS12-381 cryptographic functions 

#### Data-structures

- [aiken-lang/merkle-patricia-forestry](https://github.com/aiken-lang/merkle-patricia-forestry) - For working with modified Merkle Patricia Tries (on-chain & off-chain): a persistent & authenticated data structure to map between arbitrary keys and values.
- [anastasia-labs/aiken-linked-list](https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/aiken-linked-list) - For working with onchain distributed linked lists (on-chain): each node in the linked list is represented by a single UTxO (and thus concurrency scales with utilization, the larger the linked list, the lower the probability of experiencing UTxO contention).
- [anastasia-labs/aiken-trie](https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/aiken-trie) - For working with distributed tries (on-chain & off-chain): each trie is fully-contained within a UTxO, and it supports managing multiple distributed tries with a single validator.
  
#### Testing

- [aiken-lang/fuzz](https://github.com/aiken-lang/fuzz) - For writing Fuzzers (a.k.a generators) for property-based testing in Aiken 
- [sidan-lab/vodka](https://github.com/sidan-lab/vodka) - Offer validation utils and similar to offchain code building experience framework for unit testing.
